FrontEnd 
The Folder contains all the code for the front end of the pages, the aesthetics, layers, buttons, input fields, etc.
It also contains lines of code to code the directory between the pages allowing us to go from one page to another.
It doesn not contain link to the Database and doesnt make anything functional. This is done by the other folders.

Inhaler
This folder contains the codes for the class Inhaler and Prescription and its methods that are integrated into the frontend.
This includes adding new inhalers and its prescriptions into the user's database, logging in intakes for chosen inhalers and monitoring 
intake frequency and sending out alerts.
